# Project Moonlight: The Neuro-Symbolic Polyglot Kernel

> **2026 MoonBit Software Synthesis Challenge Application**

**Project Moonlight** is a lightweight, AI-native **Polyglot Kernel** written in MoonBit. It serves as the "Corpus Callosum" for the next generation of Sovereign AI, providing a high-speed, type-safe orchestration layer that couples Python's cognitive libraries with Rust's kinetic performance.

## The Mission
To demonstrate MoonBit as the definitive "Glue Language" for the AI Era.

- **Kinetic Core:** A MoonBit Wasm module generated by the **Ark Synthesis Engine** (**46,200+ Lines** of synthesized Tensor Math).
- **Zheng Bridge (Rust):** Zero-Copy shared linear memory (Ring Buffers).
- **Qi Bridge (Python):** Direct Native Binding for AI orchestration.

## Architecture: "The Beast"
We implement the **Qi-Zheng Singularity**:
- **Data Plane:** Shared Linear Memory (The Truth).
- **Control Plane:** MoonBit Wasm (The Logic).
- **Intelligence:** Python (The Mind).
- **Muscle:** Rust (The Body).

## The Synthesis Engine
We do not write boilerplate. We synthesize it.
- **Generator:** `scripts/synthesize_moonbit_kernel.py`
- **Output:** `core/lib/kernel.mbt`
- **Scale:** ~46,200 lines of type-safe Matrix/Vector operations (`Float64`, `Int`, `Int64`, `Byte`).
- **Features:** Unrolled loops, fixed-size matrices (`Mat4x4`), and vectorized operations.

## Status
- [x] Concept Crystallized
- [x] Kernel Scaffold
- [x] **Massive Synthesis (46k Lines)**
- [x] Rust Bridge (Zero-Copy)
- [x] Python Adapter
