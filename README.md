# Project Moonlight: The Neuro-Symbolic Polyglot Kernel

> **2026 MoonBit Software Synthesis Challenge Application**

**Project Moonlight** is a lightweight, AI-native **Polyglot Kernel** written in MoonBit. It serves as the "Corpus Callosum" for the next generation of Sovereign AI, providing a high-speed, type-safe orchestration layer that couples Python's cognitive libraries with Rust's kinetic performance.

## The Mission

To demonstrate MoonBit as the definitive "Glue Language" for the AI Era.

- **Kinetic Core:** A MoonBit Wasm module managing state and dispatch.
- **Zheng Bridge (Rust):** Zero-Copy shared linear memory (Ring Buffers).
- **Qi Bridge (Python):** Direct Native Binding for AI orchestration.

## Architecture: "The Beast"

We implement the **Qi-Zheng Singularity**:

- **Data Plane:** Shared Linear Memory (The Truth).
- **Control Plane:** MoonBit Wasm (The Logic).
- **Intelligence:** Python ( The Mind).
- **Muscle:** Rust (The Body).

## Status

- [x] Concept Crystallized
- [ ] Kernel Scaffold
- [ ] Rust Bridge
- [ ] Python Bridge

*Part of the Sovereign Stack.*
