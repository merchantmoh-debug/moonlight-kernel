### The End of the "Brain in a Jar"

**Moonlight is a Kinetic Bridge.** It connects the cognitive power of **Python (The Brain)** with the physical speed of **Rust (The Body)** using the reflex speed of **MoonBit (The Nervous System).**

> "Python thinks. Rust moves. MoonBit reacts."

---

## 🔥 THE MANIFESTO

Modern AI is broken.
*   **It is slow:** Python serialization (pickling) costs milliseconds. Reflexes need nanoseconds.
*   **It is unsafe:** C++ extensions segfault. Memory leaks.
*   **It is bloated:** You ship 4GB of CUDA libs just to add two matrices.

**Moonlight is the answer.**
It is an **AI-Native Software Factory** where the code itself is synthesized by AI, compiled to WebAssembly, and executed in a Zero-Copy Shared Memory Arena.

---

## 🧠 THE ARCHITECTURE ("THE BEAST")

This is not a library. It is a biological architecture.

### 1. The Core (MoonBit Wasm)
**46,200 Lines of Pure Logic.**
*   **Synthesized:** We did not write this by hand. The **Ark Genesis Engine (V2)** generated 46k lines of type-safe, unrolled tensor math headers in seconds.
*   **Performance:** Compiles to highly optimized Wasm (or Native code).
*   **Safety:** 100% Type-Safe. No Null Pointers. No Segfaults.

### 2. The Host (Rust + Wasmtime)
**The Zero-Copy Arena.**
*   Rust allocates the memory.
*   MoonBit lives *inside* that memory.
*   **Result:** Data is never copied. A pointer is passed. Operations are instant.

### 3. The Agent (Python)
**The Orchestrator.**
*   The AI Agent (Python) commands the body.
*   It does **not** touch the data. It sends signal.
*   The Body performs the kinetic action.

## 🛠️ THE ARK SYNTHESIS ENGINE

How do you write 46,000 lines of rigorous math code in an afternoon?
**You don't. The Machine does.**

Project Moonlight includes the **Ark Synthesizer** (`scripts/synthesize_moonbit_kernel.py`).
*   **Input:** Mathematical definitions (Matrix<T>, Vec3, Mat4x4).
*   **Process:** Python script generates MoonBit source code with loop unrolling and type specialization.
*   **Output:** `kernel.mbt` (The Beast).

> "Quantity has a quality all its own."

## 🚀 INSTALLATION

**Requirements:** `moon` (MoonBit CLI), `cargo` (Rust), `python 3.10+`.

1.  **Clone the Repo:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/merchantmoh-debug/moonlight-kernel.git
    cd moonlight-kernel
    ```

2.  **Awaken the Beast (Build):**
    ```bash
    # 1. Compile the MoonBit Core to Wasm
    cd core && moon build --target wasm

    # 2. Build the Rust Bridge
    cd ../bridge-rust && cargo build --release
    ```

3.  **Run the Protocol:**
    ```bash
    cargo run --release
    ```

## 🔐 COMMERCIAL ACCESS (V3 / GENESIS PRO)

The **V3 Genesis Engine** includes:
1.  **Automatic Differentiation (Autodiff):** Generate gradient tapes for training, not just inference.
2.  **GPU Stubs:** Bindings for `wgpu` and CUDA computation.
3.  **Graph Fusion:** Advanced kernel fusion for 100x throughput.

**To Acquire V3:**
*   **Enterprise Licensing:** Contact the maintainer directly.
